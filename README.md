# üê∂ Jade
This script performs a series of checks on the file and folder names in a specified repository on GitHub. It first sets up the GitHub API endpoint and repository information, and sets headers with an access token. It then defines rules for file and folder names, including regular expressions for allowed characters, maximum length, and prohibited words. It gets a list of all files and folders in the repository using the GitHub API, and then checks each name against the specified rules. If any issues are found, the script prints a message to the console indicating the issue and the name of the file or folder.

## Usage
